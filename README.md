# Gardevoir Strikes Back

Gardevoir Strikes Back is a single-player 2D bullet-hell game created by Tyler Guo and Andrew Chan. It was designed as a school project and makes use of the Java Processing library. 


# Game Objective

Oryx The Mad God is trying to take over the realm of Pokémon! Luckily, he appears to be weak to Psychic type attacks. One brave pokemon has escaped cativity and challenged the malign deity to a duel. Even with a type advantage, this fight will not be easy. 
As Gardevoir, you must defeat Oryx to save the Pokémon realm. The state of the Pokémon world rests on your shoulders.

# Gameplay Mechanics

The player controls Gardevoir using WASD. You are able to press multiple keys at once to move diagonally.

* W: Up
* A: Left
* S: Down
* D: Right

* Space Bar: Speed boost ability
* Mouse Click: Shoot projectiles in the direction of your cursor

NOTE: The speed boost ability has a cooldown, which is the indicator below your health bar.

The boss has 3 phases. Each phase has 3 different attacks. Figure out what they are and try to avoid them.

The player has 100 HP. The player rapidly regenerates HP after 3 seconds of not taking damage.

The different types of bullets are described in the in-game help menu. Certain shots are sometimes used to indicate a more deadly attack, so watch out!

Dodge the shots to survive! :)

# Scoring

The player wins by defeating the boss (boss health reaches 0). The player loses if your health bar reaches 0. Be careful, and good luck.

# Limitations
